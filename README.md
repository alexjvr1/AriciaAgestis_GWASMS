# AriciaAgestis_GWASMS
GWAS using ddRAD and WGS in combination with female preference data

## Aims




## 1.RawDatatoVariants.md

1.1 Call variants for ddRAD samples after mapping to the new Sanger genome. 

1.2 Call variants for NBAF whole genome sequenced samples after mapping to the new Sanger genome



## 2.SNPFiltering.md

Filter SNPs from the ddRAD samples


## 3.PhenotypeData.md



## 4.GWASwithGEMMA.md
